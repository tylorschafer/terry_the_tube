# Terry the Tube üç∫

Terry the Tube is an AI-powered beer dispensing system that combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, and conversational AI. The system acts as a sarcastic beer-dispensing tube that interacts with users through voice, requires them to answer questions before dispensing beer, and uses advanced TTS for natural-sounding speech synthesis.

## Features

- **Sarcastic AI Personality**: Bill Burr-style humor and attitude
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech-to-text input and text-to-speech responses
- **Question-Based Beer Dispensing**: Users must answer 3 questions correctly
- **Dual Interface**: Both terminal and web modes available
- **High-Quality Audio**: Advanced TTS with multiple model support
- **Real-time Processing**: Live audio transcription and response generation

## Interface Modes

### Web Interface (Default)
The web interface provides a modern, user-friendly experience with:
- Real-time chat interface with Terry
- "Hold to Talk" button for voice input
- Visual status indicators
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### Terminal Mode
The terminal mode offers a classic command-line experience with:
- Direct terminal output with colored text
- Spacebar-triggered voice recording
- Real-time processing feedback
- Session logging and timestamps

## Installation

#### Prerequisites
- [Download and install Ollama locally](https://ollama.com/download)
- Once Ollama is installed, run: `ollama run gemma3:4b-it-q8_0`
- Python 3.9.4 or higher
- macOS system with `afplay`, `say`, and `rec` commands

#### Setup
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py                    # Web interface (default)
   python main.py --mode terminal    # Terminal mode
   python main.py --info             # Show system information
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: Users press and hold spacebar (terminal) or the talk button (web) to record
2. **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper transcribes audio to text
3. **AI Response**: Ollama generates personality-appropriate responses
4. **Text-to-Speech**: TTS library synthesizes natural-sounding audio responses
5. **Beer Dispensing**: After answering 3 questions correctly, Terry dispenses beer with "BEER HERE!"
